# Jitai

**Jitai** (字体) is a userscript for [WaniKani](https://wanikani.com).
It sets the font of the current review item (vocab, kanji, radical) automatically to a random font.

>[@obskyr](https://community.wanikani.com/t/jitai-字体-the-font-randomizer-that-fits/12617#jitai-logouploadskfps3jv5ojuckdedpacfc4qn4ppng-what-is-jitai-1): One thing that can become a bit of a problem when using WaniKani is that you are only ever exposed to one font. What this means is that if you ever run into a kanji in the wild, even if you know it, you might not recognize it. Especially with handwriting and calligraphy and all that jazz being around, it helps a lot to get in a bit of training on fonts that aren’t Meiryo.

## Features

- Supports fonts installed on your machine
- Settings panel to enable/disable fonts during review
- Hover over the item to change its font back (even on the settings panel)
- Check out each font on its homepage

## Installation

1. Make sure that you have **Tampermonkey** installed
2. Click on the [`Jitai.user.js`](Jitai.user.js) file
3. Click on the "Raw" button
4. Tampermonkey should recognize it as a userscript file and ask to install it
